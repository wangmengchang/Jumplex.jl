# Jumplex.jl: a JUlia siMPLEX library

The *simplex* method is a quite standard method for solving linear programs (LPs), which has been implemented in almost all commercial solvers.

Jumplex.jl is meant to implement the basis simplex methods illustrating the basic principles.

For any application in production environments, please use commercial solvers instead.
